# JavaScript Falsy Value Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling falsy values in a division function. The original code incorrectly handles falsy values, leading to unexpected errors. The solution provides a corrected version that robustly handles these cases.

## Bug
The `foo` function is intended to divide two numbers but fails to properly handle falsy values such as `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `0`, or an empty string.  This leads to either incorrect results or runtime errors like `TypeError`.

## Solution
The solution addresses the issue by explicitly checking for all falsy values using a more comprehensive approach. It returns 0 or NaN as appropriate for these scenarios instead of throwing errors.
